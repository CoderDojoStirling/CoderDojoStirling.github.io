                    <a href="https://twinery.org/2/#/" target="_blank">Twine</a> is an online tool for writing 'Choose Your Own Adventure' stories. You can write a story with different

                    Twine is easy to use once you know how. You write a page of text (as short as you want), and can add links to other pages. So your story is a few pages with links between them, and the reader chooses their path through the story by the links they click on.

But you sometimes wonder - how would your life have been if you had won?

                <p>So you know how to use <a href="https://twinery.org/2/#/" target="_blank">Twine</a> a bit. Time to write a longer Choose Your Own Adventure story, called
                    "The Magical Wardrobe". To start you off, this is the first page:
                </p>
                <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap">

You and your Mum and Dad moved into the new house this morning. It's nice. Your first night in your new bedroom. You wake at 3am to a strange noise: a ringing coming from the attic.

You quietly creep up into the attic, and find the ringing is coming from a big old wardrobe in the corner. You:
* Panic, run down to your bedroom and hide under the covers.
* Open the wardrobe. Let's get this adventure started.
* Go wake up your Mum and Dad. They need to know.

</pre>
                <p>
                    Each choice is a link to another page, where the story continues. So what happens when you open the wardrobe?

                    Ask a mentor to play your adventure once it's done.

                <p>So you know a bit about making webpages. Now for a challenge. Make a website game about a haunted
                    house. Each webpage
                    is a room in the house, and describes the spookiness happening in the room. The links on a room’s
                    webpage take the player
                    to other rooms nearby.</p>
                <p>The player starts outside the haunted house (on the website’s main page). They then choose which
                    links to follow to take
                    them though the haunted house, and out the back door!
                <p>
                <p>Make all the webpages awesome. Use different colours, put words in different sizes,
                    have pictures (draw some), and maybe some videos (link to them).</p>
                <p>Get a badge by having a mentor play through your Haunted House website. Bonus points if they get a
