<div class="container">

    <p>You earn badges by completing tasks. Each badge has you learning - like doing an online course, or coding
        something new.</p>

    <p>Start earning badges today:
    <ol>
        <li>Pick one of the areas below that interests you. The areas go from simplest to hardest.
            If you're not sure where to start, begin with the first area: "I'm new to coding".
        </li>
        <li>Work through the area's badges in order. They're ordered simplest to hardest.</li>
        <li>For a given badge, work through the numbered tasks. You earn the badge by completing the tasks, and
            showing your work to a mentor. They'll then give you a real-life badge!

                <p>So you've got a website. You need to make it cooler. Maybe make a webpage purple, or have words in
                    crazy sizes. Learn how by
                    taking the online course at Khan Academy called <a
                            href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css" target="_blank">'Intro

                <h3>Websites Badge 3: Make a website about a Haunted House</h3>
                <p>So you know a bit about making webpages. Now for a challenge. Make a website game about a haunted
                    house. Each webpage
                    is a room in the house, and describes the spookiness happening in the room. The links on a room’s
                    webpage take the player
                    to other rooms nearby.</p>
                <p>The player starts outside the haunted house (on the website’s main page). They then choose which
                    links to follow to take
                    them though the haunted house, and out the back door!
                <p>
                <p>Make all the webpages awesome. Use different colours, put words in different sizes,
                    have pictures (draw some), and maybe some videos (link to them).</p>
                <p>Get a badge by having a mentor play through your Haunted House website. Bonus points if they get a
                    fright!
                <p>
