To the moon

Write a game about launching a rocket to the moon. The game should have
three stages: one on Earth, one in space and one on the Moon.

On Earth the player should launch the rocket. To do this the player must
press the space 10 tens times. Then the rocket should fly into the air. Once
the rocket reaches the edge of the screen, the game should switch to the
space stage.

In space the player should travel towards the moon. The player should start
at the bottom of the screen. There should be UFOs and asteroids flying around the screen.
If the player crashes into any of these they lose the game.
When the player touches the moon; the game should switch to the moon stage.

On the moon the player should start at the top of the screen and have to land
on the target positioned at the bottom of the screen. If the player hits the
target they win, otherwise if they miss it they lose the game.

Hints:
  1. For a spaceship sprite look in the sprite library (they'll be found in flying)
  2. To count the number of times space has been pressed, create a new variable
     for the rocket sprite (variables are found in the data section).
     Then every time the player hits space add one to your variable. If you
     don't know how to use variable ask a mentor
  3. In the rocket, have a while loop checking whether the space has been
     pressed ten times (using the variable we wrote).
     In the loop have an if statement checking what stage (background)
     we're using. If we are using the one for Earth or Space have the rocket
     move upwards, else if we're on the moon. We're about to land so we
     want the rocket to move down the screen.
  4. To check whether the rocket has reached the edge of the screen, check
     whether the y coordinate is bigger than 180. If it is switch the background
     and position the rocket correctly.

NOTE: I'm not 100% sure if this too complicated. I may implement it
check...

Coding Challenge

Triangles

Write a small program that takes in a number and then prints off a triangle
of that height. Here is an example:

Please enter the height of the triangle:
5

Output:
    #
   ##
  ###
 ####
#####

The program should only accept numbers that are whole and are between 3 and 10.

Advanced version

Once you've finished the basic version. Instead of printing off a right angle triangle
try and print off an equilateral triangle. Example below:

Please enter the height of the triangle:
5

Output:
    ##
   ####
  ######
 ########
##########

Website

My favourite game. Write a small website about your favourite game(s). The website
should contains:

A short of description of the game. What's about it? What are the goals of the game?
How long does it take to complete? Is there a story? Who's it developed by? And
any other relevant.

A link to the game site

Images and videos of gameplay

Advanced:

Pick a browser game you like and write a new page for it with all the details specified
above. Though also try and place the game in page.
Hint: Lookup what an iFrame is
