To the moon

Write a game about launching a rocket to the moon. The game should have
three stages: one on Earth, one in space and one on the Moon.

On Earth the player should launch the rocket. To do this the player must
press the space 10 tens times. Then the rocket should fly into the air. Once
the rocket reaches the edge of the screen, the game should switch to the
space stage.

In space the player should travel towards the moon. There should be UFOs and
asteroids flying around the screen. If the player crashes into any of these
they lose the game. When the player touches the moon; the game should switch
to the moon stage.

On the moon the player should start at the top of the screen and have to land
on the target positioned at the bottom of the screen. If the player hits the
target they win, otherwise if they miss it they lose the game.
