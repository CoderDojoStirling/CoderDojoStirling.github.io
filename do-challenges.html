                <h3>Before you start</h3>
                <p>Scratch is a nice programming language for learning how to code. If you haven't used Scratch
                    before, you can
                    do our <a href="earn-badges.html#scratch">Scratch badges</a> to get started. If you have used
                    Scratch before, pick a challenge below and do it!
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge: I Wanna Be a Rockstar</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a theatre stage with a band on it: a drummer, a guitarist, a singer, and anyone else you want.
                    When you click on a person (or their instrument), the instrument sound should play. So when you
                    click on the drums, you hear drums!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Sprite Library has a “Music” category with useful sprites in it.</li>
                    <li>The Sound Library has lots of sounds you can use. Or record your own!</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: Try clicking your band members at the right time, so it sounds like a proper song!</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Bear wants Dinner</h3>
                <p>Make a story about a bear searching for his dinner. The bear should move around, and tell the
                    following
                    joke to a frog:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bear: "Why don't bears like fast food?"
                    <li>Frog: "I don't know: Why don't bears like fast food?"
                    <li>Bear: "Because they can't catch it!"</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hints:
                <ul>
                    <li>You can find a ‘bear’ sprite in the Scratch sprite library. Or draw your own.</li>
                    <li>Sprites can speak with the ‘say’ command.</li>
                    <li>Sprites can have a conversation (one speaks after the other) using the ‘broadcast’ and
                        ‘message’ commands
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge: Maze of Insults</h3>
                <p>Create a maze game. If you collide with a wall, you get teleported to the start, and told “you
                    clumsy oaf”!</p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need 3 sprites: a player, the maze walls, and a finish point.</li>
                    <li>Use the ‘touch’ sensor to work out if the player has collided with a wall. You can detect
                        when two sprites collide, or when one sprite collides with a colour.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge: Animate Your Name</h3>
                <p>
                    Make an animation of your name, so each letter does something cool like make a sound, or move around
                    or change colour. I’m called GREG, so the G might spin around, the R might change from red to blue,
                    and so on.
                    The animation should start when the Green Flag is clicked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add letter sprites for your name: look in the Sprite Library under Letters. So I would add G, R,
                        E and G.
                    </li>
                    <li>For each character sprite, make it do something cool when the Green Flag is clicked.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: Make the animation cooler. You could make the background change, or make a bird fly
                    around, or make the letters do things when you click on them.</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Catching Mice</h3>
                <p>Create a game where the player gets points when the cat catches a mouse, and loses points when
                    the cat steps in a dog-poo.</p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need lots of sprites: a cat, lots of mice, a lots of dog poo.</li>
                    <li>Use the ‘touch’ sensor to work out if the cat has collided with something.</li>
                    <li>Use a ‘variable’ to track the score.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: can you make this game two-player?</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Aquarium</h3>
                <p>Build an aquarium with fish swimming around and plants at the bottom. The fish should turn round
                    when they hit the aquarium edge.</p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need 2 sprites to start: a fish and a plant.</li>
                    <li>Look in the ‘motion’ section to make the fish move.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: Add a shark into the aquarium that is controlled with the arrow keys. Make the
                    fish run away when they bump into the shark.</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Space Miner</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a game about a space miner:
                <ul>
                    <li>There’s a solar system with planets and asteroids (small lumps of space rock).</li>
                    <li>There’s a space ship.</li>
                    <li>The player moves the space ship to collect the asteroids. The player gets one point for running
                        over each asteroid.
                    </li>
                    <li>The space ship blows up if it crashes into a planet.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need different sprites for the spaceship, asteroids and planets.</li>
                    <li>Use the ‘touch’ sensor to work out if the spaceship has collided with an asteroid or planet. You
                        can detect when
                        two sprites collide, or when one sprite collides with a colour.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge: Hide and Seek</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a Hide and Seek game with the Scratch Cat: the Cat will appear somewhere on the screen, then
                    vanish after 2 seconds.
                    6 seconds later, the Cat will appear somewhere else on the screen, then vanish again after 2
                    seconds. It does this forever.
                    The player gets one point when they click on the cat, and lose a point if they click on the
                    background.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>Use two starting sprites: the Scratch Cat and the Background. Work out how to add and remove
                        points from a score counter when these sprites are clicked.
                    </li>
                    <li>Work out how to make the Scratch Cat appear and disappear with the ‘hide’ and ‘show’ commands.
                    </li>
                    <li>Work out how to change the location of the Scratch Cat to a random x and y position.</li>
                    <li>If you need more help, the Scratch website has ‘step by step’ instructions for making a hide and
                        seek game. Click on ‘Explore’ at the top of the main webpage, then look for ‘Hide and Seek Game’
                        on the right hand side.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Halloween Challenge: Escape the Graveyard</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a game about escaping a graveyard. You start at one side of the graveyard, and have to escape
                    through a gate on the other side. The graveyard has grave-stones in the ground, and ghosts that move
                    around. If you collide with a grave-stone or a ghost, you get teleported to the start.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need some sprites: the player, gravestones, and ghosts</li>
                    <li>Use the ‘touch’ sensor to work out if the player has collided with a gravestone or ghost. You
                        can detect when two sprites collide, or when one sprite collides with a colour.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: Make the graveyard more spooky. What about making an invisible ghost appear when the
                    player hits a gravestone? Maybe it says “boo!” (record the sound effect)</p>

                <a name="parachute-jump"></a>
                <h3 name="parachute-jump">Challenge: Parachute Jump</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a game about someone doing a parachute jump, and having to dodge moving clouds. If they hit a cloud, they
                    lose the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>Draw your parachutist</li>
                    <li>Draw some clouds - you'll need a few!</li>
                    <li>To make the game, put the parachutist near the top of the screen (they won't move). Now
                        make each cloud move from the bottom of the screen to the top, and it will look like the
                        parachutist is falling! There is a trick to this, as you want each cloud to start
                        off-screen at the bottom, and move up until it goes off-screen at the top. When the cloud
                        gets to the top, move it to the bottom again!:
                        <ul>
                            <li>To start the cloud off-screen at the bottom, set y to be less than -180 (try -200)</li>
                            <li>To check when the cloud has gone off-screen at the top, check if y is more than 180
                                (try 200)</li>
                            <li>Scratch doesn't like putting sprites off-screen, but you can trick it: every time
                                you move the sprite's position (x and y), put "set size to 200%" before, and "set size to 100%" after.
                                Strange, but this seems to work!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: make things harder, with more clouds moving randomly at different speeds. You could
                    also keep score by counting how many clouds the parachutist dodged. Or make things look cooler by
                    changing the background: what about thunder and lightning, or snow?</p>

                <a name="maths-quiz"></a>
                <h3 name="maths-quiz">Challenge: Maths Quiz</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a quiz where the player has to multiply random numbers together. "What's 2 times 7?".
                    "14". "Correct!".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll need a sprite to ask the quiz question. For now, ask: "what's 2 times 7?"</li>
                    <li>Let the player enter the answer</li>
                    <li>Compare the player's answer against the real answer (14). If they match, the sprite should say "correct!" or "wrong!" if they don't</li>
                    <li>Now make the quiz question use random numbers (not just 2 and 7). This is a bit tricky:
                        <ul>
                            <li>You will need two 'variables' to store the random numbers</li>
                            <li>Scratch can pick a random number for you using the 'pick' block (look under 'operators')</li>

                <h3 name="wind-whistle">Challenge: Whistle for the Wind</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a scene with a windmill (or wind turbine) and a cloud. Make the windmill turn and the cloud move across the sky.
                    Now here's the fun bit: make the windmill turn faster the louder you whistle (or yell) into your computer's microphone.
                    The cloud should move faster too. The louder you whistle, the stronger the wind!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>Make a windmill with sails that turn: you can use "turn x degrees" (look under 'motion')</li>
                    <li>Make a cloud that moves across the sky
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use 'set x' and 'set y' to set the cloud's starting position</li>
                            <li>Make the cloud move using 'change x'</li>
                            <li>Once the cloud crosses the whole screen, move it back to its starting position (so we don't lose it off the screen!)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Now for the whistling bit.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Scratch has a 'loudness' value (look under 'sensing'). It measures how loud the noise is that
                                your computer's microphone hears, from 0 to 100.
                            </li>
                            <li>Use the 'loudness' value to change how fast the windmill turns and the cloud moves.</li>
                            <li>For the windmill, try "turn 'loudness' degrees"</li>
                            <li>For the cloud, try "change x by 'loudness'" (to make the cloud go in the other direction, multiply by -1)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Add more clouds, and make their starting position random (the y value).</li>
                    <li>Change the colour of the clouds as they move</li>
                    <li>Add a meter that shows how much electricity is generated by the windmill</li>

                <p>
                    Make a game that measures your reaction time: how fast you can click when Scratch cat changes
                    from his normal orange colour to blue. At the end of the game, show your reaction time (it will be
                    in milliseconds, which is a second divided into 1000 parts). What's the fastest you can click?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need a Scratch cat sprite, with a orange and a purple costume.</li>
                    <li>You can measure reaction time using the 'timer' block in the 'sensing' section: use 'reset timer'
                        when you want to start timing, and assign 'timer' to a variable when you want to record the end
                        reaction time.
                    </li>
                    <li>You can also use the timer to wait a few seconds at the game start before you switch Scratch cat's
                        costume.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use different backdrops for different stages of the game: to show instructions at the beginning,
                        to show when to click on scratch cat, and to show reaction time at the end.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced:
                <ul>
                    <li>Make the player pay attention: randomise the time at the game start before you change scratch cat's costume.</li>
                    <li>Tell the player off if they click too early (before scratch cat is purple).</li>
                    <li>Let the player have multiple goes, and calculate their average reaction time.</li>

                <h3>Challenge: Insult Generator</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a Scratch program that generates random insults :-) Scratch cat first asks for your name, then insults
                    you. Here goes..
                    <ul>
                        <li>"What's your name?"</li>
                        <li>"Greg"</li>
                        <li>"Hi Greg. You eat like a greasy baboon!". Or maybe "Hi Greg. You run like a purple hippo!"</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need a Scratch cat sprite.</li>
                    <li>Now get Scratch cat to ask your name, and say hello ("Hi Greg"). Useful Scratch blocks:
                        <ul>
                            <li>'ask and wait' under Sensing</li>
                            <li>'say' under Looks</li>
                            <li>'join' under Operators (used to join words together into a sentence)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Generating the insult is the tricky bit. Each insult is a sentence with the same structure:
                        "Hi (Greg - name). You (eat - doing word) like a (greasy - describing word) (baboon - naming word). So we'll generate the insult
                        by randomly picking a doing word, a describing word and a naming word,
                        then making a sentence out of them:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make a list of doing words (verbs). Use 'Make a list' under 'Data'. How about: eat, run and swim.</li>
                            <li>Make a list of describing words (adjectives). How about: greasy, smelly, grumpy.</li>
                            <li>Make a list of naming words (nouns). How about: baboon, cardboard box, dolphin.</li>
                            <li>Now we'll generate the insult by randomly picking a word from each of the three lists, and combining them
                                into a sentence. To randomly pick a word, use 'item random of list-name' under Data. To combine the words
                                into a sentence, use 'join' under Operators. You'll need to use 'join' multiple times.</li>
                            <li>Go make some fun insults!</li>

                <p>
                  Write a game about flying to the moon. There should be three stages in your
                  game: one set on Earth; one in space and one on the moon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To start the rocket the player should press the space bar five times. Then the
                  rocket should fly into the air. When the rocket reaches the top of the screen,
                  the background should be changed to the next background (e.g. from Earth to space). Along with placing the
                  rocket at the bottom of the screen again. The player should be
                  able to move the rocket left and right using the arrow keys. There should be
                  Aliens and other space-ships flying around. If the player touches one of these
                  they lose the game. When the player reaches the last stage (the moon) a target
                  should appear. The target should be placed at the top of the screen.
                  If the player hits the target then they win the game.

                <p>
                    Fortunately, it's raining school supplies. Your sprite needs to walk back
                    and forth across the screen catching pencils, notebooks and calculators in their
                    backpack. Set up a timer so that players have one minute to collect as many as they can. Set up
                    a counter to count how many items they catch.

                <ul>
                    <li>Draw a sprite of you in school uniform, with a backpack. You will need two costumes:
                        one for when you are walking left, and another for walking right.</li>
                    <li>Draw a pencil, notebook and calculator sprite. To make them fall from the sky, set their
                        original location to a random position at the top of the screen, then move their location
                        down the screen. When they get to the bottom, move them back to the top.</li>
                    <li>An easy way to 'catch' a notebook (or whatever) in your backpack is to make the backpack a special
                        color, then add an action to the notebook sprite when it touches the special color. So you could
                        hide the notebook, and add a point to the score.

                    Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9fO-YuWPSk">this video</a>.
                    The aim of the game is to guide a frog from the bottom of the screen to the top of the screen, whilst crossing lanes
                    of a busy road. Each lane contains moving cars, buses, cyclists and other vehicles - don't let the frog get run over!
                    The player moves the frog using the arrow keys (hopping forwards, back, left or right). The player wins by guiding the
                    frog safely to the top of the screen.

                    <li>You'll need some vehicle sprites. Move them left to right (or right to left) along a road. You
                        can draw roads in the background image. To have constant traffic, start each sprite on the the
                        left of the screen, then move it right. When the sprite gets to the right of the screen, move its
                        location back to the left.</li>
                    <li>You can detect collisions between the frog and a vehice based on colour (when touching "frog" colour) or

                    Create a Halloween scene: for example a spooky forest or a graveyard. When you click on anything
                    in the scene, something scary should happen. A spider drops from this tree; an owl flies out of that one;
                    a ghost pops out from behind a gravestone; a witch flies cackling across the moon. How many spooky
                    surprises can you put in?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hints:
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll need sprites. Look in the sprite library, or draw one, or load one in from an image.</li>
                    <li>For surprises, a sprite could move or appear, say something, or make a sound. You could even
                        record your best ghost noise!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Santa Present Drop</h3>
                <p>
                    Santa needs help dropping presents down chimneys. Make a game where Santa flies across the sky
                    over some houses with chimneys. When the mouse is clicked, Santa drops a present which falls downwards.
                    If the present hits a chimney, you score 1 point. If the present hits something else (like a roof),
                    you score nothing. In either case, the present vanishes, and you get to try again. You win once you've
                    scored 10 points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hints:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You'll need a Santa sprite. Make him fly across the top of the screen. When Santa hits the edge of the
                            screen, make him fly in the opposite direction.</li>
                        <li>You'll need a sprite of some houses with chimneys. Use two different colours for the chimney tops
                            and the rest of the houses.
                        </li>
                        <li>You'll need a present sprite. When the mouse is pressed, make the present appear at Santa's location.
                            Then move its position gradually down the screen. You can work out if the present lands on a chimney.
                            top by using "if touching chimney top colour". You can check if the present lands on a house instead
                            by using "if touching house colour".
                        </li>
                        <li>You'll need a variable to keep track of the score. Add 1 to the score when a present drops on a
                            chimney top.
                        </li>

                        when it doesn't
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add levels: once you score 10 points, move up one level. Santa should fly faster as each level increases.
                        You will need a second "level" variable for this.

                    Your website should have descriptions and pictures of the items you want and links to where they
                    can be bought.
                    You could prioritise the items with a star rating to say how much you want that item, or
                    organise it by price so
                    everyone can find the right gift for you!

                <h3>Halloween Challenge: Haunted House</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a website game about a haunted house. Each webpage is a room in the house, and describes
                    the
                    spookiness happening in the room.
                    The links on a room’s webpage take the player to other rooms nearby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The player starts outside the haunted house (on the website’s main page). They then choose which
                    links to follow to take them
                    though the haunted house, and out the back door!

                <p>
                    Make a website about the Olympics. You can have pages about different sports and athletes. Maybe

                    should pop up with the animal noise ("baa").
                </p>
                <p>
                    This challenge involves adding some javascript to your webpage. You'll need to get two parts working

                    <ul>
                        <li>A front-place explaining that this is your film website, with links to web-pages about each film.</li>
                        <li>A web-page for each film. The page should contain (at least) the film's title, image and a short summary of what it's about.
                            You could also review and rate the film. It is a 4-star or 5-star film?</li>
                        <li>You could also have web-pages about actors and actresses in these films.</li>
                        <li>Be careful with the pictures you use on your website: you may need permission to use some pictures you link to.
                            Wikipedia has film images with 'fair use' permissions. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_(2013_film)">Frozen wikipedia page</a> has
                            a image in the top right. Clicking on it shows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_(2013_film)#/media/File:Frozen_(2013_film)_poster.jpg">a bigger image</a>, with a "Share or embed this file"
                            option in the bottom right. The 'embed' option has HTML that will show the image in a webpage.

                  you were. Along with some pictures of the place. Every page should
                  link to the others.

                <h3>Rate my teacher</h3>
                <p>
                    Write a website about the teachers in your school. Each teacher should have their own page,
                    describing what they teach, how much homework they give, how strict they are, what their classroom
                    is like, etc. You could add a drawing of each teacher to help new pupils identify them. Don't
                    forget the Head Teacher! You could arrange the front page so that the teachers are organised by
                    subject.

                <h3>Best Memes Ever</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a website with the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cat+memes&tbm=isch">best memes ever</a>.
                    It should be possible to view memes by animal type, subject and year, so you'll need different web pages for this.

                <h3>Fun with Fonts</h3>
                <p>
                    How text appears on a webpage depends on which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font">font</a> is used.
                    For example, we could use the <span style="font-family: courier; font-weight: bold">Courier font</span>, or
                    <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: bold">Verdana font</span>.

                    Write a webpage that shows the same piece of text with different fonts: use the sentence
                    "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog". The text will feel different, depending on the font used.
                    Try finding fonts that look official, funny, old or futuristic. What's your favourite?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>Work out how to use CSS to use a particular font for a piece of text. Try using
                        the fonts that are built into your web browser.</li>
                    <li>You can find lots more fonts at <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>. They
                        also have a nice <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started">Getting Started</a> guide.

                <h3>Challenge: Reversing Names</h3>
                <p>Write a program that asks someone their name, then outputs it in reverse. So “GREG” becomes
                    “GERG”.</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Capital Cities</h3>
                <p>
                    Write a program that asks for a country name, then outputs the capital city. So “France” returns
                    “Paris”.
                </p>
                <p>

                    <li>Start off with just 3 known country/capital combinations: get the information from
                        wikipedia.
                    </li>
                    <li>You’ll need to handle an unknown country being entered: just return “unknown country”.</li>

                </p>
                <p>

                    <li>Expand to lots of countries. Considering using the ‘hash table’ data structure.</li>
                    <li>Can your program handle “ fRanCE “, and still return “Paris”?</li>
                    <li>Can your program do the reverse, so “Paris” returns “France”?</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge: Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
                <p>
                    Write a program that plays ‘rock paper scissors’:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask the player to pick ‘rock’, ‘paper’ or ‘scissors’</li>
                    <li>Have the computer choose its move (get it to make a random choice)</li>
                    <li>Compare the choices and decide who wins</li>
                    <li>Print the results</li>

                    <li>Let the player play again.</li>
                    <li>Keep a record of the score e.g. (Player: 3 / Computer: 6)</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge: Hangman</h3>
                <p>
                    Write a program that plays ‘hangman’. The player guesses letters to complete a secret word.
                    You decide how many turns they get. On each turn:
                <ul>
                    <li>The player guesses a letter</li>
                    <li>The computer prints out the word, but shows ‘@‘ for letters not guessed yet. So if the
                        word was ‘dog’ and the player had only guessed ‘d’, the computer would show: ‘d@@’
                    </li>
                    <li>If the player has guessed all letters in the word, it prints the whole word and ‘you
                        won!’
                    </li>
                    <li>If the player hasn’t won, the computer prints ‘number of turns remaining: ___’, and the
                        player
                        has another go.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge: Sentence Analyser</h3>
                <p>
                    Write a program that counts the number of words in a sentence. For example, for “i am an example
                    sentence”, the program would print 5 (words).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then improve your sentence analyser:
                <ul>
                    <li>Print out the total number of vowels in the sentence. So we’d print 9 for the example.</li>
                    <li>Print out counts for each vowel. For the example sentence, there is 1 ‘i’ and 3 ‘a’s and 5
                        ‘e’s.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make sure your program works for lowercase and uppercase letters. So ‘A’ and ‘a’ should be
                        treated the same. The phrase ‘A cat’ has two vowels, which are both the letter ‘a’.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge: Calculator</h3>
                <p>
                    Write a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply or divide two numbers. Make the calculator
                    accept the two numbers
                    and command one line at a time. Like:
                <ul>
                    <li>2</li>
                    <li>+</li>
                    <li>3</li>
                    <li>And then the calculator outputs 5</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: make the calculator accept everything on one line, like: 2 + 3.</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Fizz Buzz</h3>
                <p>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz"
                    instead of the number and
                    for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
                    print
                    “FizzBuzz".</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Fibonacci</h3>
                <p>Write a program that prints out the first 100 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. In the Fibonacci
                    sequence the first two numbers are zero and one.
                    Every number after that is the sum of the previous 2 numbers. So the first seven numbers are: 0
                    1 1
                    2 3 5 8.</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Secret Spy Messages</h3>
                <p>
                    Write a program that turns a sentence into a secret message by replacing each letter with the
                    next
                    letter. So the letter ‘a’ is
                    replaced by ‘b’, and ‘f’ by ‘g’, etc. Here’s an example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Original sentence: ‘attack at dawn’</li>
                    <li>Secret message: ‘buubdl bu ebxo’
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Hint: letters are represented inside a computer as numbers. This is called ASCII: so an ‘a’ in
                    ASCII
                    is 97. You’ll need to convert the sentence letters
                    into ASCII, do some addition, then convert them back again. Google to learn about ASCII, and how
                    you
                    convert letters to ASCII (and back again)
                    in your particular programming language.</p>
                <p>More advanced: so you’ve written a program that ‘encrypts’ a sentence into a secret message.
                    Write a
                    ‘decrypt’ program that turns a secret message back into the original sentence.</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Anagram Detector</h3>
                <p>
                    Write a program that outputs whether two phrases are anagrams of one another. For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>"Clint Eastwood" is an anagram of "Old West Action"</li>
                    <li>"parliament" is NOT an anagram of "partial man"</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>

                <h3>Challenge: Reverse Factorial</h3>
                <p>
                    Write a program that outputs whether a given number is a factorial (or not).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A factorial of a particular number is that number multiplied by all numbers below it.
                    So 5! (meaning 5 factorial) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calculating 5! is easy. But we want to reverse this. Write a program that tells us
                    that "120" is "5!". The program should work for any number, either reporting that
                    that the number is a factorial, or "NONE" if it isn't. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>120 = 5!</li>
                        <li>150   NONE</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hint: divide the input number by successively larger numbers until you get to "1" as the result:
                        120 -> 120/2 -> 60/3 -> 20/4 -> 5/5 -> 1 => 5!</li>
                    <li>Here are some examples to test your program with:
                        <br>
                        Challenge input:
                        <ul>

                <p>
                    Write a program that lets you create and manage a 'to-do list'. You should be able to: add an item, delete an item,
                    and view the whole list (of items).

                    Here's my example to-do list:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Assemble an army of dolphins that will do as I command</li>
                        <li>Use dolphin army to achieve world domination</li>
                        <li>Eat chocolate chip ice cream with sprinkles on top</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>When the program starts, it should ask the user what to do: the user enters an alphabet letter to
                        select an option. So it could be 'a' for add, 'd' for delete, and 'l' for list, and 'e' for exit program.</li>
                    <li>Code 'add an item': the user should enter the item to add (e.g. 'Eat chocolate chip ice cream with sprinkles on top').</li>
                    <li>Code 'view list': show all the items the user has entered.</li>
                <li>Code 'delete an item': the user should enter the list item to delete (numbering list items will make it easier to select one)</li>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Write a game that measures your reaction time: how fast you hit the space-bar when told 'hit it!'. At the end of the game, show
                    your reaction time in milliseconds (a second divided into 1000 parts). What's your fastest reaction time?
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>When the program starts, show instructions explaining the game, and get the user to hit space-bar
                        when they're ready to begin.
                    <li>Wait say 5 seconds, then output "Hit it!" and start a timer.</li>
                    <li>When the user hits the spacebar, stop the timer.</li>
                    <li>Output the timer result (the reaction time).</li>
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Make the player pay attention: randomise the time at the game start before outputting "Hit it!"</li>
                    <li>Tell the player off if they hit the space-bar too early (before "Hit it!").</li>
                    <li>Let the player have multiple goes, and calculate their average reaction time.</li>
                    <li>Make the game more interesting by getting the user to enter a random letter between 'A' and 'Z',
                        rather than the space-bar.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Challenge: Insult Generator</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a program that generates random insults :-) The program first asks for your name, then insults
                    you. Here goes..
                <ul>
                    <li>"What's your name?"</li>
                    <li>"Greg"</li>
                    <li>"Hi Greg. You eat like a greasy baboon!". Or maybe "Hi Greg. You run like a purple hippo!"</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>When the program starts, ask the user for their name, then say hello ("Hi Greg").
                    <li>Generating the insult is the tricky bit. Each insult is a sentence with the same structure:
                        "Hi (Greg - name). You (eat - verb) like a (greasy - adjective) (baboon - noun). So we'll generate the insult
                        by randomly picking a verb, adjective and noun, then making a sentence out of them:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make a list of verbs. How about: eat, run and swim.</li>
                            <li>Make a list of adjectives. How about: greasy, smelly, grumpy.</li>
                            <li>Make a list of nouns. How about: baboon, cardboard box, dolphin.</li>
                            <li>Now we'll generate the insult by randomly picking a word from each of the three lists, and combining them
                                into a sentence.</li>
                            <li>Go make some fun insults!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced:
                <ul>
                    <li>Make the insults more complicated and longer. Use bigger lists of verbs, adjectives and nouns.</li>
                    <li>Why stop with random sentence generation - try random story generation! Use the same approach,
                        but your lists are now of whole sentences rather than single words. So define the story's standard structure,
                        then randomly fill in story gaps with randomly picked sentences:
                        <ul>
                            <li>I was born (in Paris, under an autumn sky | with a tail | 3 days early).</li>
                            <li>My mother (ate chips all day | loved to dance | howled at the moon).</li>
                            <li>All I could do was (vacuum the cat | take up break dancing | cook bacon and eggs).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  The program should only accept positive numbers and the input

                <p>
                    So you're going back to school. Write a program that manages your school timetable.
                    It should record which subjects you take during your school day. E.g.:
                    <ul>
                        <li>MON-PERIOD1: CHEMISTRY</li>

                <p>
                    Getting your driving licence requires you to pass a "theory test". Write a program that lets you
                    practice the theory test: the program asks you a set of multiple-choice questions, tells you whether you
                    correctly answered each question, and tells you your final score at the end. Here's an example question:
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will find that driving smoothly can:
                    <ol>
                    <li>reduce journey times by about 15%</li>
                    <li>increase fuel consumption by about 15%</li>
                    <li>reduce fuel consumption by about 15% (correct answer)</li>
                    <li>increase journey times by about 15%</li>
                    </ol>
                    When presented with this question, the user types in the number of the answer they think is correct
                    (e.g. 1 - incorrect). The program then states whether the user is correct or not, and moves onto the
                    next question.

                ...
                </pre>
                </p>
                <h4>Hints</h4>
                <p>To start with, get things working by using numbers (rather than words) for the gift counts:
                <pre>
                On the second day of Christmas my true love sent to me:
                2 Turtle Doves
                and 1 Partridge in a Pear Tree
                </pre>
                </p>
                <h4>Advanced</h4>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Load all the gifts ("Turtle Doves", "Partridge in a Pear Tree", ..) from an input file, so you can change them easily.</li>
                        <li>Can you get the computer to play the melody of Twelve Days Of Christmas as well?</li>
                    </ul>

                    At Stirling CoderDojo, we have micro:bits to play with. Ask a mentor if you would like to use one. A micro:bit is a cool
                    little computer with LEDs, a compass, motion detection and temperature detection. So you can make it
                    to do cool stuff like show the temperature when you shake it! There’s a web-based Block Editor (like
                    Scratch) for writing and testing code. When you’re happy with the code, you need to transfer the
                    code to the micro:bit. To do this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plug the micro:bit into your computer using the usb cable. The micro:bit should show up in your
                            computer as a new hard drive</li>
                        <li>Click ‘compile’ in the Block Editor, and your code will download to your computer in a file called
                            ‘something.hex’</li>
                        <li>Drag and drop the ‘something.hex’ file onto the micro:bit hard drive. The code should now be
                            running on the micro:bit!</li>
                    </ul>
