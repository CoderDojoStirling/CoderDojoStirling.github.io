                <h3>Before you start</h3>
                <p>Scratch is a nice programming language for learning how to code. If you haven't used Scratch
                    before, you can
                    do our <a href="earn-badges.html#scratch">Scratch badges</a> to get started. If you have used
                    Scratch before, pick a challenge below and do it!
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge: I Wanna Be a Rockstar</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a theatre stage with a band on it: a drummer, a guitarist, a singer, and anyone else you want.
                    When you click on a person (or their instrument), the instrument sound should play. So when you
                    click on the drums, you hear drums!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Sprite Library has a “Music” category with useful sprites in it.</li>
                    <li>The Sound Library has lots of sounds you can use. Or record your own!</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: Try clicking your band members at the right time, so it sounds like a proper song!</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Bear wants Dinner</h3>
                <p>Make a story about a bear searching for his dinner. The bear should move around, and tell the
                    following
                    joke to a frog:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bear: "Why don't bears like fast food?"
                    <li>Frog: "I don't know: Why don't bears like fast food?"
                    <li>Bear: "Because they can't catch it!"</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hints:
                <ul>
                    <li>You can find a ‘bear’ sprite in the Scratch sprite library. Or draw your own.</li>
                    <li>Sprites can speak with the ‘say’ command.</li>
                    <li>Sprites can have a conversation (one speaks after the other) using the ‘broadcast’ and
                        ‘message’ commands
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge: Maze of Insults</h3>
                <p>Create a maze game. If you collide with a wall, you get teleported to the start, and told “you
                    clumsy oaf”!</p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need 3 sprites: a player, the maze walls, and a finish point.</li>
                    <li>Use the ‘touch’ sensor to work out if the player has collided with a wall. You can detect
                        when two sprites collide, or when one sprite collides with a colour.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge: Animate Your Name</h3>
                <p>
                    Make an animation of your name, so each letter does something cool like make a sound, or move around
                    or change colour. I’m called GREG, so the G might spin around, the R might change from red to blue,
                    and so on.
                    The animation should start when the Green Flag is clicked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add letter sprites for your name: look in the Sprite Library under Letters. So I would add G, R,
                        E and G.
                    </li>
                    <li>For each character sprite, make it do something cool when the Green Flag is clicked.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: Make the animation cooler. You could make the background change, or make a bird fly
                    around, or make the letters do things when you click on them.</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Catching Mice</h3>
                <p>Create a game where the player gets points when the cat catches a mouse, and loses points when
                    the cat steps in a dog-poo.</p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need lots of sprites: a cat, lots of mice, a lots of dog poo.</li>
                    <li>Use the ‘touch’ sensor to work out if the cat has collided with something.</li>
                    <li>Use a ‘variable’ to track the score.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: can you make this game two-player?</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Aquarium</h3>
                <p>Build an aquarium with fish swimming around and plants at the bottom. The fish should turn round
                    when they hit the aquarium edge.</p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need 2 sprites to start: a fish and a plant.</li>
                    <li>Look in the ‘motion’ section to make the fish move.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: Add a shark into the aquarium that is controlled with the arrow keys. Make the
                    fish run away when they bump into the shark.</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Space Miner</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a game about a space miner:
                <ul>
                    <li>There’s a solar system with planets and asteroids (small lumps of space rock).</li>
                    <li>There’s a space ship.</li>
                    <li>The player moves the space ship to collect the asteroids. The player gets one point for running
                        over each asteroid.
                    </li>
                    <li>The space ship blows up if it crashes into a planet.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need different sprites for the spaceship, asteroids and planets.</li>
                    <li>Use the ‘touch’ sensor to work out if the spaceship has collided with an asteroid or planet. You
                        can detect when
                        two sprites collide, or when one sprite collides with a colour.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge: Hide and Seek</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a Hide and Seek game with the Scratch Cat: the Cat will appear somewhere on the screen, then
                    vanish after 2 seconds.
                    6 seconds later, the Cat will appear somewhere else on the screen, then vanish again after 2
                    seconds. It does this forever.
                    The player gets one point when they click on the cat, and lose a point if they click on the
                    background.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>Use two starting sprites: the Scratch Cat and the Background. Work out how to add and remove
                        points from a score counter when these sprites are clicked.
                    </li>
                    <li>Work out how to make the Scratch Cat appear and disappear with the ‘hide’ and ‘show’ commands.
                    </li>
                    <li>Work out how to change the location of the Scratch Cat to a random x and y position.</li>
                    <li>If you need more help, the Scratch website has ‘step by step’ instructions for making a hide and
                        seek game. Click on ‘Explore’ at the top of the main webpage, then look for ‘Hide and Seek Game’
                        on the right hand side.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Halloween Challenge: Escape the Graveyard</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a game about escaping a graveyard. You start at one side of the graveyard, and have to escape
                    through a gate on the other side. The graveyard has grave-stones in the ground, and ghosts that move
                    around. If you collide with a grave-stone or a ghost, you get teleported to the start.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need some sprites: the player, gravestones, and ghosts</li>
                    <li>Use the ‘touch’ sensor to work out if the player has collided with a gravestone or ghost. You
                        can detect when two sprites collide, or when one sprite collides with a colour.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: Make the graveyard more spooky. What about making an invisible ghost appear when the
                    player hits a gravestone? Maybe it says “boo!” (record the sound effect)</p>

                <a name="parachute-jump"></a>
                <h3 name="parachute-jump">Challenge: Parachute Jump</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a game about someone doing a parachute jump, and having to dodge moving clouds. If they hit a cloud, they
                    lose the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>Draw your parachutist</li>
                    <li>Draw some clouds - you'll need a few!</li>
                    <li>To make the game, put the parachutist near the top of the screen (they won't move). Now
                        make each cloud move from the bottom of the screen to the top, and it will look like the
                        parachutist is falling! There is a trick to this, as you want each cloud to start
                        off-screen at the bottom, and move up until it goes off-screen at the top. When the cloud
                        gets to the top, move it to the bottom again!:
                        <ul>
                            <li>To start the cloud off-screen at the bottom, set y to be less than -180 (try -200)</li>
                            <li>To check when the cloud has gone off-screen at the top, check if y is more than 180
                                (try 200)</li>
                            <li>Scratch doesn't like putting sprites off-screen, but you can trick it: every time
                                you move the sprite's position (x and y), put "set size to 200%" before, and "set size to 100%" after.
                                Strange, but this seems to work!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: make things harder, with more clouds moving randomly at different speeds. You could
                    also keep score by counting how many clouds the parachutist dodged. Or make things look cooler by
                    changing the background: what about thunder and lightning, or snow?</p>

                <a name="maths-quiz"></a>
                <h3 name="maths-quiz">Challenge: Maths Quiz</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a quiz where the player has to multiply random numbers together. "What's 2 times 7?".
                    "14". "Correct!".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll need a sprite to ask the quiz question. For now, ask: "what's 2 times 7?"</li>
                    <li>Let the player enter the answer</li>
                    <li>Compare the player's answer against the real answer (14). If they match, the sprite should say "correct!" or "wrong!" if they don't</li>
                    <li>Now make the quiz question use random numbers (not just 2 and 7). This is a bit tricky:
                        <ul>
                            <li>You will need two 'variables' to store the random numbers</li>
                            <li>Scratch can pick a random number for you using the 'pick' block (look under 'operators')</li>

                <h3 name="wind-whistle">Challenge: Whistle for the Wind</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a scene with a windmill (or wind turbine) and a cloud. Make the windmill turn and the cloud move across the sky.
                    Now here's the fun bit: make the windmill turn faster the louder you whistle (or yell) into your computer's microphone.
                    The cloud should move faster too. The louder you whistle, the stronger the wind!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>Make a windmill with sails that turn: you can use "turn x degrees" (look under 'motion')</li>
                    <li>Make a cloud that moves across the sky
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use 'set x' and 'set y' to set the cloud's starting position</li>
                            <li>Make the cloud move using 'change x'</li>
                            <li>Once the cloud crosses the whole screen, move it back to its starting position (so we don't lose it off the screen!)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Now for the whistling bit.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Scratch has a 'loudness' value (look under 'sensing'). It measures how loud the noise is that
                                your computer's microphone hears, from 0 to 100.
                            </li>
                            <li>Use the 'loudness' value to change how fast the windmill turns and the cloud moves.</li>
                            <li>For the windmill, try "turn 'loudness' degrees"</li>
                            <li>For the cloud, try "change x by 'loudness'" (to make the cloud go in the other direction, multiply by -1)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Add more clouds, and make their starting position random (the y value).</li>
                    <li>Change the colour of the clouds as they move</li>
                    <li>Add a meter that shows how much electricity is generated by the windmill</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Challenge: Reaction Time</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a game that measures your reaction time: how fast you can click when Scratch cat changes
                    from his normal orange colour to blue. At the end of the game, show your reaction time (it will be
                    in milliseconds, which is a second divided into 1000 parts). What's the fastest you can click?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need a Scratch cat sprite, with a orange and a purple costume.</li>
                    <li>You can measure reaction time using the 'timer' block in the 'sensing' section: use 'reset timer'
                        when you want to start timing, and assign 'timer' to a variable when you want to record the end
                        reaction time.
                    </li>
                    <li>You can also use the timer to wait a few seconds at the game start before you switch Scratch cat's
                        costume.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use different backdrops for different stages of the game: to show instructions at the beginning,
                        to show when to click on scratch cat, and to show reaction time at the end.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced:
                <ul>
                    <li>Make the player pay attention: randomise the time at the game start before you change scratch cat's costume.</li>
                    <li>Tell the player off if they click too early (before scratch cat is purple).</li>
                    <li>Let the player have multiple goes, and calculate their average reaction time.</li>

                <h3>Challenge: Insult Generator</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a Scratch program that generates random insults :-) Scratch cat first asks for your name, then insults
                    you. Here goes..
                    <ul>
                        <li>"What's your name?"</li>
                        <li>"Greg"</li>
                        <li>"Hi Greg. You eat like a greasy baboon!". Or maybe "Hi Greg. You run like a purple hippo!"</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need a Scratch cat sprite.</li>
                    <li>Now get Scratch cat to ask your name, and say hello ("Hi Greg"). Useful Scratch blocks:
                        <ul>
                            <li>'ask and wait' under Sensing</li>
                            <li>'say' under Looks</li>
                            <li>'join' under Operators (used to join words together into a sentence)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Generating the insult is the tricky bit. Each insult is a sentence with the same structure:
                        "Hi (Greg - name). You (eat - doing word) like a (greasy - describing word) (baboon - naming word). So we'll generate the insult
                        by randomly picking a doing word, a describing word and a naming word,
                        then making a sentence out of them:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make a list of doing words (verbs). Use 'Make a list' under 'Data'. How about: eat, run and swim.</li>
                            <li>Make a list of describing words (adjectives). How about: greasy, smelly, grumpy.</li>
                            <li>Make a list of naming words (nouns). How about: baboon, cardboard box, dolphin.</li>
                            <li>Now we'll generate the insult by randomly picking a word from each of the three lists, and combining them
                                into a sentence. To randomly pick a word, use 'item random of list-name' under Data. To combine the words
                                into a sentence, use 'join' under Operators. You'll need to use 'join' multiple times.</li>
                            <li>Go make some fun insults!</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Challenge: To the Moon</h3>
                <p>
                  Write a game about flying to the moon. There should be three stages in your
                  game: one set on Earth; one in space and one on the moon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To start the rocket the player should press the space bar five times. Then the
                  rocket should fly into the air. When the rocket reaches the top of the screen,
                  the background should be changed to the next background (e.g. from Earth to space). Along with placing the
                  rocket at the bottom of the screen again. The player should be
                  able to move the rocket left and right using the arrow keys. There should be
                  Aliens and other space-ships flying around. If the player touches one of these
                  they lose the game. When the player reaches the last stage (the moon) a target
                  should appear. The target should be placed at the top of the screen.
                  If the player hits the target then they win the game.
                </p>

                <h4>Hints</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      For a spaceship sprite look in the sprite library (they'll be found in flying).
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      To count the number of times the player has pressed space make a variable
                      (found under data).
                      Then every time space is pressed add one to this variable. Use the wait until
                      block to make the sure the rocket doesn't fly off until the variable equals five.
                      Ask a mentor for help if you haven't used variables before.

                    <p>
                      To change the background check whether the y coordinate is bigger than 180,
                      then use the switch background block.

              Write a small game about popping balloons. In the game the
              balloons should float from the bottom to the top of the screen. When
              the player clicks on a balloon then it should disappear from the screen,
              and a popping sound should be played. Then one should be added to their
              score.
              There should be other items floating up the screen; if the player
              clicks on any of these they should lose a point.

              <li>
                Add a lives system to the game. If the player clicks on something

                <p>
                    Make a website about the Olympics. You can have pages about different sports and athletes. Maybe
                    a
                    page about Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Include pictures and videos (try including a youtube
                    video).
                    Link to other websites where your readers can find out more.

                <p>
                    Make a webpage with lots of animal pictures. When you click on a picture ("sheep"), an alert box
                    should pop up with the animal noise ("baa").

                    This challenge involves adding some javascript to your webpage. You'll need to get two parts working
                    (do some searching online!):
                    <ul>
                        <li>To make something happen when someone clicks on an image, you will need an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=onclick+attribute">onclick attribute</a></li>
                        <li>To popup the animal noise, you will need an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=alert+box">alert box</a>

                    I bet you've got a few favourite films. So make a website about them! You will need:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A front-place explaining that this is your film website, with links to web-pages about each film.</li>
                        <li>A web-page for each film. The page should contain (at least) the film's title, image and a short summary of what it's about.
                            You could also review and rate the film. It is a 4-star or 5-star film?</li>
                        <li>You could also have web-pages about actors and actresses in these films.</li>
                        <li>Be careful with the pictures you use on your website: you may need permission to use some pictures you link to.
                            Wikipedia has film images with 'fair use' permissions. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_(2013_film)">Frozen wikipedia page</a> has
                            a image in the top right. Clicking on it shows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_(2013_film)#/media/File:Frozen_(2013_film)_poster.jpg">a bigger image</a>, with a "Share or embed this file"
                            option in the bottom right. The 'embed' option has HTML that will show the image in a webpage.

                <h3>Challenge: Hangman</h3>
                <p>
                    Write a program that plays ‘hangman’. The player guesses letters to complete a secret word.
                    You decide how many turns they get. On each turn:
                <ul>
                    <li>The player guesses a letter</li>
                    <li>The computer prints out the word, but shows ‘@‘ for letters not guessed yet. So if the
                        word was ‘dog’ and the player had only guessed ‘d’, the computer would show: ‘d@@’
                    </li>
                    <li>If the player has guessed all letters in the word, it prints the whole word and ‘you
                        won!’
                    </li>
                    <li>If the player hasn’t won, the computer prints ‘number of turns remaining: ___’, and the
                        player
                        has another go.

                <p>
                    Write a program that counts the number of words in a sentence. For example, for “i am an example
                    sentence”, the program would print 5 (words).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then improve your sentence analyser:
                <ul>
                    <li>Print out the total number of vowels in the sentence. So we’d print 9 for the example.</li>
                    <li>Print out counts for each vowel. For the example sentence, there is 1 ‘i’ and 3 ‘a’s and 5
                        ‘e’s.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make sure your program works for lowercase and uppercase letters. So ‘A’ and ‘a’ should be
                        treated the same. The phrase ‘A cat’ has two vowels, which are both the letter ‘a’.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Write a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply or divide two numbers. Make the calculator
                    accept the two numbers
                    and command one line at a time. Like:
                <ul>
                    <li>2</li>
                    <li>+</li>
                    <li>3</li>
                    <li>And then the calculator outputs 5</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: make the calculator accept everything on one line, like: 2 + 3.</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Fizz Buzz</h3>
                <p>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz"
                    instead of the number and
                    for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
                    print
                    “FizzBuzz".</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Fibonacci</h3>
                <p>Write a program that prints out the first 100 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. In the Fibonacci
                    sequence the first two numbers are zero and one.
                    Every number after that is the sum of the previous 2 numbers. So the first seven numbers are: 0
                    1 1
                    2 3 5 8.</p>

                <h3>Challenge: Secret Spy Messages</h3>
                <p>
                    Write a program that turns a sentence into a secret message by replacing each letter with the
                    next
                    letter. So the letter ‘a’ is
                    replaced by ‘b’, and ‘f’ by ‘g’, etc. Here’s an example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Original sentence: ‘attack at dawn’</li>
                    <li>Secret message: ‘buubdl bu ebxo’
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Hint: letters are represented inside a computer as numbers. This is called ASCII: so an ‘a’ in
                    ASCII
                    is 97. You’ll need to convert the sentence letters
                    into ASCII, do some addition, then convert them back again. Google to learn about ASCII, and how
                    you
                    convert letters to ASCII (and back again)
                    in your particular programming language.</p>
                <p>More advanced: so you’ve written a program that ‘encrypts’ a sentence into a secret message.
                    Write a

                <h3>Challenge: Reverse Factorial</h3>
                <p>
                    Write a program that outputs whether a given number is a factorial (or not).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A factorial of a particular number is that number multiplied by all numbers below it.
                    So 5! (meaning 5 factorial) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calculating 5! is easy. But we want to reverse this. Write a program that tells us
                    that "120" is "5!". The program should work for any number, either reporting that
                    that the number is a factorial, or "NONE" if it isn't. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>120 = 5!</li>
                        <li>150   NONE</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Hint: divide the input number by successively larger numbers until you get to "1" as the result:

                <p>
                    Make a program that generates random insults :-) The program first asks for your name, then insults
                    you. Here goes..
                <ul>
                    <li>"What's your name?"</li>
                    <li>"Greg"</li>
                    <li>"Hi Greg. You eat like a greasy baboon!". Or maybe "Hi Greg. You run like a purple hippo!"</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul>
                    <li>When the program starts, ask the user for their name, then say hello ("Hi Greg").
                    <li>Generating the insult is the tricky bit. Each insult is a sentence with the same structure:
                        "Hi (Greg - name). You (eat - verb) like a (greasy - adjective) (baboon - noun). So we'll generate the insult
                        by randomly picking a verb, adjective and noun, then making a sentence out of them:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make a list of verbs. How about: eat, run and swim.</li>
                            <li>Make a list of adjectives. How about: greasy, smelly, grumpy.</li>
                            <li>Make a list of nouns. How about: baboon, cardboard box, dolphin.</li>
                            <li>Now we'll generate the insult by randomly picking a word from each of the three lists, and combining them
                                into a sentence.</li>
                            <li>Go make some fun insults!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Make the insults more complicated and longer. Use bigger lists of verbs, adjectives and nouns.</li>
                    <li>Why stop with random sentence generation - try random story generation! Use the same approach,
                        but your lists are now of whole sentences rather than single words. So define the story's standard structure,
                        then randomly fill in story gaps with randomly picked sentences:
                        <ul>
                            <li>I was born (in Paris, under an autumn sky | with a tail | 3 days early).</li>
                            <li>My mother (ate chips all day | loved to dance | howled at the moon).</li>
                            <li>All I could do was (vacuum the cat | take up break dancing | cook bacon and eggs).</li>
                        </ul>

                    little computer with LEDs, a compass, motion detection and temperature detection. So you can make it
                    to do cool stuff like show the temperature when you shake it! There’s a web-based Block Editor (like
                    Scratch) for writing and testing code. When you’re happy with the code, you need to transfer the
                    code to the micro:bit. To do this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plug the micro:bit into your computer using the usb cable. The micro:bit should show up in your
                            computer as a new hard drive</li>
                        <li>Click ‘compile’ in the Block Editor, and your code will download to your computer in a file called
                            ‘something.hex’</li>
                        <li>Drag and drop the ‘something.hex’ file onto the micro:bit hard drive. The code should now be
                            running on the micro:bit!</li>
