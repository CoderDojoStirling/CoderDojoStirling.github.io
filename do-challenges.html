                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Before you start</h3>
                <p>Scratch is a nice programming language for learning how to code. If you haven't used Scratch
                    before, you can
                    do our <a  href="earn-badges.html#scratch">Scratch badges</a> to get started. If you have used
                    Scratch before, pick a challenge below and do it!
                </p>

                <br/>
                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Scratch: I Wanna Be a Rockstar</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a theatre stage with a band on it: a drummer, a guitarist, a singer, and anyone else you want.
                    When you click on a person (or their instrument), the instrument sound should play. So when you
                    click on the drums, you hear drums!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>The Sprite Library has a “Music” category with useful sprites in it.</li>
                    <li>The Sound Library has lots of sounds you can use. Or record your own!</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: Try clicking your band members at the right time, so it sounds like a proper song!</p>

                <br/>
                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Scratch: Bear wants Dinner</h3>
                <p>Make a story about a bear searching for his dinner. The bear should move around, and tell the
                    following
                    joke to a frog:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Bear: "Why don't bears like fast food?"

                    <li>Bear: "Because they can't catch it!"</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hints:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>You can find a ‘bear’ sprite in the Scratch sprite library. Or draw your own.</li>
                    <li>Sprites can speak with the ‘say’ command.</li>
                    <li>Sprites can have a conversation (one speaks after the other) using the ‘broadcast’ and
                        ‘message’ commands

                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Scratch: Maze of Insults</h3>
                <p>Create a maze game. If you collide with a wall, you get teleported to the start, and told “you
                    clumsy oaf”!</p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>You will need 3 sprites: a player, the maze walls, and a finish point.</li>
                    <li>Use the ‘touch’ sensor to work out if the player has collided with a wall. You can detect
                        when two sprites collide, or when one sprite collides with a colour.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <br/>
                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Scratch: Spring Garden</h3>
                <p>Make a spring garden in Scratch, with moving parts and things to click on. Add flowers, bees,
                    butterflies, the sun and clouds.</p>
                <p>Some ideas:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Click flowers to make them bloom. Add sound effects.</li>
                    <li>Make butterflies flap their wings and fly around.</li>
                    <li>Make bees glide from flower to flower.</li>
                    <li>Click the sun to make it smile, spin or change colour.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Hints:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Use different costumes to make flowers bloom: from bud to full bloom.</li>
                    <li>Switch butterfly costumes to flap the wings.</li>
                    <li>Make butterflies move randomly by changing X and Y a little in a loop.</li>
                    <li>More bees around the garden by setting a path, or use “glide to” blocks to move between flower sprites.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>


                <br/>
                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Scratch: Animate Your Name</h3>
                <p>
                    Make an animation of your name, so each letter does something cool like make a sound, or move around
                    or change colour. I’m called GREG, so the G might spin around, the R might change from red to blue,
                    and so on.
                    The animation should start when the Green Flag is clicked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Add letter sprites for your name: look in the Sprite Library under Letters. So I would add G, R,
                        E and G.
                    </li>
                    <li>For each character sprite, make it do something cool when the Green Flag is clicked.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: Make the animation cooler. You could make the background change, or make a bird fly
                    around, or make the letters do things when you click on them.</p>

                <br/>
                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Scratch: Catching Mice</h3>
                <p>Create a game where the player gets points when the cat catches a mouse, and loses points when
                    the cat steps in a dog-poo.</p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>You will need lots of sprites: a cat, lots of mice, a lots of dog poo.</li>
                    <li>Use the ‘touch’ sensor to work out if the cat has collided with something.</li>
                    <li>Use a ‘variable’ to track the score.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: can you make this game two-player?</p>

                <br/>
                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Scratch: Aquarium</h3>
                <p>Build an aquarium with fish swimming around and plants at the bottom. The fish should turn round
                    when they hit the aquarium edge.</p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>You will need 2 sprites to start: a fish and a plant.</li>
                    <li>Look in the ‘motion’ section to make the fish move.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: Add a shark into the aquarium that is controlled with the arrow keys. Make the
                    fish run away when they bump into the shark.</p>

                <br/>
                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Scratch: Space Miner</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a game about a space miner:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>There’s a solar system with planets and asteroids (small lumps of space rock).</li>
                    <li>There’s a space ship.</li>
                    <li>The player moves the space ship to collect the asteroids. The player gets one point for running
                        over each asteroid.
                    </li>
                    <li>The space ship blows up if it crashes into a planet.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>You will need different sprites for the spaceship, asteroids and planets.</li>
                    <li>Use the ‘touch’ sensor to work out if the spaceship has collided with an asteroid or planet. You
                        can detect when
                        two sprites collide, or when one sprite collides with a colour.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <br/>
                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Scratch: Hide and Seek</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a Hide and Seek game with the Scratch Cat: the Cat will appear somewhere on the screen, then
                    vanish after 2 seconds.
                    6 seconds later, the Cat will appear somewhere else on the screen, then vanish again after 2
                    seconds. It does this forever.
                    The player gets one point when they click on the cat, and lose a point if they click on the
                    background.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Use two starting sprites: the Scratch Cat and the Background. Work out how to add and remove
                        points from a score counter when these sprites are clicked.
                    </li>
                    <li>Work out how to make the Scratch Cat appear and disappear with the ‘hide’ and ‘show’ commands.
                    </li>
                    <li>Work out how to change the location of the Scratch Cat to a random x and y position.</li>
                    <li>If you need more help, the Scratch website has ‘step by step’ instructions for making a hide and
                        seek game. Click on ‘Explore’ at the top of the main webpage, then look for ‘Hide and Seek Game’
                        on the right hand side.
                    </li>

                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Scratch: Escape the Halloween Graveyard</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a game about escaping a graveyard. You start at one side of the graveyard, and have to escape
                    through a gate on the other side. The graveyard has grave-stones in the ground, and ghosts that move
                    around. If you collide with a grave-stone or a ghost, you get teleported to the start.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>You will need some sprites: the player, gravestones, and ghosts</li>
                    <li>Use the ‘touch’ sensor to work out if the player has collided with a gravestone or ghost. You
                        can detect when two sprites collide, or when one sprite collides with a colour.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: Make the graveyard more spooky. What about making an invisible ghost appear when the
                    player hits a gravestone? Maybe it says “boo!” (record the sound effect)</p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2" name="parachute-jump">Scratch: Parachute Jump</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a game about someone doing a parachute jump, and having to dodge moving clouds. If they hit a
                    cloud, they
                    lose the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Draw your parachutist</li>
                    <li>Draw some clouds - you'll need a few!</li>
                    <li>To make the game, put the parachutist near the top of the screen (they will only move sideways). Now
                        make each cloud move from the bottom of the screen to the top, and it will look like the
                        parachutist is falling! There is a trick to this, as you want each cloud to start
                        off-screen at the bottom, and move up until it goes off-screen at the top. When the cloud
                        gets to the top, move it to the bottom again!:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                            <li>To start the cloud off-screen at the bottom, set y to be less than -250 (try -251)</li>
                            <li>To check when the cloud has gone off-screen at the top, check if y is more than 230
                            </li>
                            <li>Scratch doesn't like putting sprites off-screen, but you can trick it: every time
                                you move the sprite's position (x and y), put "set size to 200%" before, and "set size
                                to 100%" after.
                                Strange, but this seems to work!
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>To make the game tricky, start each cloud at a random x position. Use the "pick random" block
                        between -250 and 250.</li>
            </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: make things harder, with more clouds moving randomly at different speeds. You could
                    also keep score by counting how many clouds the parachutist dodged. Or make things look cooler by
                    changing the background: what about thunder and lightning, or snow?</p>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>You'll need a sprite to ask the quiz question. For now, ask: "what's 2 times 7?"</li>

                    <li>Now make the quiz question use random numbers (not just 2 and 7). This is a bit tricky:

                            <li>You will need two 'variables' to store the random numbers</li>
                            <li>Scratch can pick a random number for you using the 'pick' block (look under

                    <li>Generating the insult is the tricky bit. Each insult is a sentence with the same structure:

                        word). So we'll generate the insult
                        by randomly picking a doing word, a describing word and a naming word,
                        then making a sentence out of them:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                            <li>Make a list of doing words (verbs). Use 'Make a list' under 'Data'. How about: eat, run
                                and swim.
                            </li>
                            <li>Make a list of describing words (adjectives). How about: greasy, smelly, grumpy.</li>
                            <li>Make a list of naming words (nouns). How about: baboon, cardboard box, dolphin.</li>
                            <li>Now we'll generate the insult by randomly picking a word from each of the three lists,
                                and combining them
                                into a sentence. To randomly pick a word, use 'item random of list-name' under Data. To
                                combine the words
                                into a sentence, use 'join' under Operators. You'll need to use 'join' multiple times.

                    backpack. Set up a timer so that players have one minute to collect as many as they can. Set up

                <p>
                    Make an Easter egg hunt game - the player wins by finding 10 Easter eggs hidden behind trees, rocks and animals
                    in a country scene. Eggs should appear in random locations for a few seconds then vanish again. If you
                    click the egg then you gain a point.
                <p>
                    Hints:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Make a few egg sprites. You can draw one, or mess with a balloon sprite in the Scratch library.</li>

                    <li>Place an egg in a random position, show it for a few seconds, then hide it. You can do this with the blocks "hide", "show", "wait".</li>
                    <li>If the egg is clicked, then add 1 to the score variable. The game finishes when the score reaches 10.</li>
                    <li>You can hide eggs behind other sprites (like the animals and trees) by using the "go back 1 layer" block, or "go to front layer" to move it to the front.</li>
                    <li>Advanced: keep track of how long it takes for someone to finish the game. When the game ends, tell them how long they took.</li>

                <p>
                    It rains a lot in April. Make a game where you dodge raindrops. Get hit by 3 raindrops, and the game
                    finishes.
                    The player should be told how many seconds they survived.
                <p>
                    Hints:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>You will need a player sprite to move left and right at the bottom of the screen, to dodge the
                        raindrops.
                        Draw a sprite yourself, or pick one from the scratch library. Then make it move left and right
                        when the

                    </li>
                    <li>You will need raindrops to fall from the sky. Draw one raindrop. When the game starts, hide this
                        raindrop, then "clone"
                        it every half a second (look in the "control" section). Use the "when i start as a clone" block
                        to tell
                        each cloned raindrop what to do (also in the "control" section). Each clone should:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                            <li>Appear using "show"</li>
                            <li>Start at a random location at the top of the screen. Use a y position of 180, and a
                                random x position between 240 and -240
                            </li>
                            <li>Move down the screen</li>
                            <li>Delete itself at the bottom using the "delete this clone" block</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You can check if the player has hit a raindrop using the "touching sprite" block in the
                        "sensing" section
                    </li>
                    <li>You will need a variable to keep track of how many hits the player has taken. When the player
                        touches a raindrop,
                        subtract 1 from the variable. When the variable gets to zero, the game finishes
                    </li>
                    <li>You can measure how long the player survived using the 'timer' block in the 'sensing' section.
                        Use 'reset
                        timer' to start timing, and assign 'timer' to a variable to stop timing (when the game finishes)
                    </li>

                <p>
                    Scratch Cat has gone on holiday to the beach. He will need regular food, drink and sunscreen to
                    enjoy himself. If he doesn't get
                    enough of each then he'll be hungry, thirsty and sunburnt. Scratch Cat will then come home from
                    holiday early as he feels unwell.
                    Sadness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make a "virtual pet" game where you keep Scratch Cat on his beach holiday for as long as possible.
                    You will need to give him food,
                    drink or sunscreen, depending on what he needs. The basic idea is that you have "variables" that
                    show how Scratch Cat is
                    feeling, like: "Hungry: 4". Scratch Cat gets hungrier over time, so the variable starts at zero and
                    increases 2 points every
                    5 seconds. The player can reduce points by feeding Scratch Cat: they do this by clicking on some cat
                    food. If the "Hungry" variable
                    gets to 20 points, then Scratch Cat feels unwell and goes home early: the game finishes. You will
                    need three different variables:
                    "Hungry" (fixed by cat food), "Thirsty" (fixed by a water bowl), and "Sunburnt" (fixed by
                    sunscreen).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get started, let's deal with Scratch Cat being hungry:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Add the Scratch Cat sprite and a beach background</li>
                    <li>Add a variable called "Hungry", and set it to zero when the game starts. Then make the variable
                        increase 2 points every 5 seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add a "cat food" sprite. Reduce the "Hungry" variable by two points when the player clicks on
                        the cat food.
                    </li>
                    <li>Check to see if the "Hungry" variable is 20 points or more. If it is, then stop the game: make
                        Scratch Cat say that he's going home.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next steps:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Add "Thirsty" and "Sunburnt" variables, fixed by a water bowl and sunscreen</li>
                    <li>Increase the variables randomly, so "Hungry" increases between 2 to 4 points, every 5 to 10
                        seconds
                    </li>
                    <li>When the game finishes, tell the player how long Scratch Cat was on his beach holiday.</li>

                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Scratch: Spy Name Generator</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a Scratch program that generates random spy names :-) Scratch cat first asks for your name,
                    then
                    tells you your spy name. Here goes..
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>"What's your name?"</li>
                    <li>"Greg"</li>
                    <li>"Hi Greg. Your spy name is Smelly Weasel". Or maybe "Hi Greg. Your spy name is Pink Milkshake"
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>You will need a Scratch cat sprite.</li>
                    <li>Now get Scratch cat to ask your name, and say hello ("Hi Greg"). Useful Scratch blocks:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                            <li>'ask and wait' under Sensing</li>
                            <li>'say' under Looks</li>
                            <li>'join' under Operators (used to join words together into a sentence)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Generating the spy name is the tricky bit. Each spy name is a sentence with the same structure:
                        "Hi (Greg - name). Your spy name is (Smelly - describing word) (Weasel - noun)". So we'll
                        generate the spy name
                        by randomly picking a describing word and a naming word,
                        then making a sentence out of them:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                            <li>Make a list of describing words (adjectives). Use 'Make a list' under 'Data'. How about:
                                Smelly, Pink
                                and Furry.
                            </li>
                            <li>Make a list of naming words (nouns). How about: Weasel, Milkshake, Goblin.</li>
                            <li>Now we'll generate the spy name by randomly picking a word from each list,
                                and combining them
                                into a sentence. To randomly pick a word, use 'item random of list-name' under Data. To
                                combine the words
                                into a sentence, use 'join' under Operators. You'll need to use 'join' multiple times.
                            </li>
                            <li>Go make some fun spy names!</li>
                        </ul>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>To finish things off, let's replace Scratch cat with M: head of the Secret Service in James Bond
                    films.
                    Make a new sprite for M: they should be dressed in normal clothes. Now add an extra "spy" costume
                    for M: they should be dressed like a spy, with dark glasses, a fake moustache, and maybe all in
                    black.
                    When M asks your name, show them in their normal costume. But when M tells you your spy name, show
                    them in their spy costume. Cooool.

                    <li>Third, at school. Make something interesting happen, like being attacked by a giant octopus, or

                    <li>Scratch has different sprites and backdrops you can choose from, or you can create your own. For

                    <li>So you and your Mum have a conversation in the bedroom: Mum says "wake up!", then you say "ok!".
                        Your two sprites have to take turns saying something. Use the "broadcast" and "when I receive"
                        blocks in the "events" section
                        to make this happen. Watch this <a

                <p>
                    Rudolf woke up on Christmas morning and couldn't find his red nose. Make a reindeer sprite either
                    from a picture or by drawing in Scratch. Draw a complicated maze sprite and hide a sprite of
                    Rudolf's nose somewhere in it. Make Rudolf move with keys on the keyboard. He should bounce off the
                    walls of the maze. When he finds his nose, change sprite costumes so that his nose disappears from
                    the maze and appears on Rudolf.

                    <li>You will need a bird sprite.  The bird sprite will fly across the screen from left to right. Make the sprite start again at the left side of the screen when it reaches the right hand side.
                    <li>Use the <b>when tilted front and back</b> blocks in the Microbit section to make your bird fly higher or lower on the screen.

                <p>Scratch Cat has made a New Year’s resolution not to eat any more doughnuts. Make a game where Scratch
                    Cat has to dodge flying doughnuts. If he hits a doughnut, he loses the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Put Scratch Cat sprite on the left of the screen. Make him move up, down, left and right when
                        you press the arrow keys.</li>
                    <li>Draw a doughnut sprite.</li>
                    <li>To make the game, make doughnuts start just off the right side of the screen, then fly left
                        until they go off the left side of the screen and vanish. Scratch Cat will have to dodge them.
                        The easiest way to do this is to have just one doughnut sprite. When the sprite starts, immediately “hide” it,
                        then use “create clone of myself” forever. Use “when I start as a clone” to first show each clone
                        doughnut, place it off the right side of the screen (with a random "y" location), then move it to the left side of the
                        screen and “delete this clone”.
                    </li>

                    <li>When the pancake hits the side of the screen it should bounce off.
                    <li>If the pancake touches the pan it is "caught" and could be placed on the pan.
                    <li>If the pancake hits the floor it could change costumes to a splattered mess.
                    <li>The pan needs to move side to side so it can catch the pancake.  You might want to flip the pan so it points in the direction of motion.
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced: Add a variable to keep score - gain a point if you catch a pancake, and lose a point if it hits the floor.</p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Scratch: Make a Leap Year Checker</h3>
                <p>February has 29 days in a leap year, and 28 days otherwise. Make a leap year checker, where Scratch cat asks you for a year,
                    and tells you if it's a leap year or not.
                </p>
                <p>Getting started:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                        <li>Use the 'Ask' block to get the year (it's in the Sensing area)</li>
                        <li>Store the 'answer' in a variable called 'year'</li>
                        <li>You then need to check if 'year' is a leap year, which means it's a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 100
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                                <li>A multiple of 4 means it's in the 4 times table: 4, 8, 12..</li>
                                <li>A multiple of 100 means it's in the 100 times table: 100, 200, 300.. You actually want 'year' <u>not</u> to be a multiple of 100</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>You can work out if the 'year' variable is a multiple with the 'mod' block (in the Operators area). Mod gives the remainder of dividing a number, so 9 'mod' 4 is 1, since 9 divided by 4 is 2, with 1 left over.
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                                <li>A multiple of 4 would be: 'year' mod 4 is 0</li>
                                <li>A multiple of 100 would be: 'year' mod 100 is 0. For 'not a multiple of 100', drop the result into a 'not' block (in the sensing area)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Now you know about 'mod', use this with an 'if then else' block (in the Control area) to work out if 'year' is a leap year or not, and say the result with a 'say' block (in the Looks area).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p >Examples:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                        <li>1896: leap year</li>
                        <li>1900: not leap year</li>
                        <li>2020: leap year</li>
                        <li>2025: not leap year</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>For more advanced, whether a year is a leap year is more tricky than I said:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                        <li>The year is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 100 (which you just did).</li>
                        <li>Or, the year is a multiple of 400</li>
                    </ul>
                    So 2000 is a leap year, since it's a multiple of 400. Change your code to handle this.

                    and pig sprites around to tell the story. You can use "broadcast" blocks in the "Events" section to send messages between sprites, so one
                    sprite can say/do something after another sprite is done. You'll need 3 scenes, one for each house. Here's what happens in each scene:

                    Pig: "Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin"
                    Wolf: "Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!"
                    Wolf: blows house down, pig runs away

                    Pig: "Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin"
                    Wolf: blows house, nothing happens
                    Wolf: "I'll get those pigs. I'll climb down the chimney"
                    Wolf: goes down chimney, lands on fire
                    Wolf: "Ow, ow, ow - I've hurt my bum!"

                <p>
                    There’s a picnic in your street - yum! Your sprite needs to walk back and forth across the screen
                    catching cakes, sandwiches and drinks. Set up a timer so that players have one minute to collect as
                    many as they can. Set up a counter to count how many they can catch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hints:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Draw a sprite of yourself, with a plate. You will need two costumes: one for when you are walking

                    </li>
                    <li>Draw a cake, sandwich and fizzy drinnk sprite. To make them fall from the sky, set their original

                    <li>An easy way to 'catch' a cake (or whatever) on your plate is to make the plate a special colour,
                        then add an action to the cake sprite when it touches the special colour. So you could hide the
                        cake, and add a point to the score.

                            messages to make things in the play happen in order, like the curtain coming up before
                            the actors say their lines.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Make a picture of a wood - with trees, animals, a house, and a sky - then change it 4 times so it's

                            So the "winter" tree would have snow on it.

                <p>
                    Make a zoo with various animals in it: an elephant, some monkeys, a tiger, and anything else you want.
                    When you click on an animal, it should make a noise. So when you click on the tiger, it roars!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>You will need some animal pictures. The Sprite Library has an “Animal” category with useful sprites in it.
                    </li>
                    <li>You will need some animal noises. The Sound Library has some "Animal" sounds you can use.
                        Or record your own! If you can't find the right sound, then just write it in a speech bubble: "rooooarrrr"!

                        You would change the animal's costume to do this.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add in some people visiting the zoo. When you click on them, they could say how they feel about

                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Scratch: Beach Clean</h3>

                <p>
                    Make a game called "Beach Clean", where you clean all bottles from a beach by clicking on them. You win when no bottles are left.
                    Make the simple game first (instructions below), and then the real game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the simple game, show a beach with one bottle at a random location. When you click the bottle, it vanishes,
                    and a "finished" screen appears. Instructions:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                        <li>
                            Make a sprite that looks like a bottle, or just pick any sprite from the library (and change it later).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When the game starts (the green flag is clicked), set the backdrop to a beach. Also set the bottle to a
                            random location, and "show" it. To set the location, use the "got to x and y" block, together with the
                            "pick random" block to set the x and y positions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When the bottle is clicked, "hide" it and broadcast a message called "finished".
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Listen for the "finished" message, and switch the backdrop to a green screen saying "FINISHED!"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make the game cooler by adding sounds for when the bottle is clicked, and the game finishes. And
                            make sure the bottle looks like a bottle.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                    Now for the real game. It's the same as the simple game, but we show lots of bottles, adding one bottle
                    every second. The game finishes when the player clicks all the bottles. This game is harder to build, as it
                    uses clones and variables. Instructions:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                        <li>
                            Make sure the simple game works.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We make lots of bottles by "cloning" the bottle sprite. When the game starts, "hide" the bottle sprite
                            (and dont "show" it). Then add a "forever" block. Inside this block, "create a clone" of the bottle,
                            and "wait" 1 second. Then..
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add a "when I start as a clone" block. In that block, "show" the clone bottle, and set it to
                            a random location (use the "set x and y" block from the simple game).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In your "when this sprite clicked" block (from the simple game), make sure the bottle clone
                            "hides", and add "delete this clone". AND MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE the "broadcast finished" block - FOR NOW.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The game should now show lots of bottles which vanish when clicked, but the game never finishes.
                            Let's fix this with variables.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add two variables called "bottles" and "running". "bottles" will count how many bottles are
                            on the beach. "running" will be 1 when the game runs, and 0 when it's not.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When the game starts, set "bottles" to 0 and "running" to 1.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In the "when I start as a clone" block, change "bottles" by 1. In the "when the sprite is clicked"
                            block (where you delete the bottle), change "bottles" by -1. So "bottles" now counts bottles on
                            the beach. "bottles" will be 0 when the player has clicked all bottles. We can use this to finish the game.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We will stop the game when "bottles" is 0. In the "when this sprite is clicked" block, use an
                            "if" block to check if "bottles" is 0, and broadcast "finished" to stop the game (and change to the "FINISHED" backdrop).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The last thing we need to do is stop creating new bottles. In your "when I receive 'finished'" block,
                            set "running" to 0. Now find the code when the game starts where you create a new bottle using
                            "create a clone" and wait 1 second. Make an "if 'running' > 0" block, and put the "clone" and
                            "wait" blocks inside - so you only create new bottles when the game is running.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You should now have a working Beach Clean game - well done!
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Scratch: Mix and Match Body Game</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a game that lets you mix and match body parts:  make the strangest, funniest or coolest person by mixing
                    different heads, body and legs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To get started:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                        <li>Make a single person out of 3 sprites stacked on top of one another: a head sprite, a body
                            sprite (neck down to waist), and a legs sprite. So you will need to draw a head, a body and some legs.</li>
                        <li>Add some more heads to mix and match. Right now you have a head sprite with one "costume". "Duplicate"
                            your first head costume, and mess with it to make a second costume. Try and keep it roughly the
                            same size as the first, so it matches up with the body and legs.</li>
                        <li>Now use the same "duplicate" trick to make more body costumes, and legs costumes.</li>
                        <li>To get mix and match working, make each sprite clickable. Use the "when this sprite clicked" event,
                            and make it switch to the next costume with the "next costume" block.</li>
                        <li>You should now be able to mix and match different people by clicking the head, body and legs
                            sprites to get cool combinations. Have fun!</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    More challenging:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                        <li>Add more head, body and legs costumes. You could add different animals, or superheros, or aliens!
                            Make sure they are roughly the same size as your first person so that the heads / bodies / legs
                            still match together.</li>
                        <li>Add a hat sprite on top of the head sprite, and add a bunch of hat costumes.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    Animate the Coronation of Prince Charles, where he is crowned King Charles III. We'll do the short version:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Make (or find) a sprite of Prince Charles standing up. It doesn't need to look like him.</li>
                    <li>Make a sprite of a throne - a big, fancy chair for Prince Charles to stand in front of.</li>
                    <li>Make 3 sprite of things Prince Charles needs (click each thing below to see a picture of it):
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">

                    <li>
                        Now for the Coronation:

                            <li>Prince Charles moves in front of the throne</li>
                            <li>The crown appears on Charles' head</li>
                            <li>The orb appears in Charles' hand</li>
                            <li>The sceptre appears in Charles' other hand</li>
                            <li>Charles says "I am King Charles III"</li>
                            <li>Someone else moves into view and says "God Save the King!"</li>
                            <li>The End</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                Hints
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>To get everything into its correct place at the start of the animation, move sprites to where you want them, and note down their x and y co-ordinates. Then on the "When Green Flag clicked" event, move the sprites to these co-ordinates.</li>
                    <li>Use "hide" and "show" to make sprites appear and disappear.</li>
                    <li>To make things happen in the right order, you can use messages (see the Events section). So Prince Charles could say "I am King Charles III" and broadcast the "king-crowned" message. And the onlooker sprite could use the "When I receive the 'kind-crowned' message to then say "God Save the King!"</li>

                <p>
                    Have you played the memory game called 'Pairs'? You lay out a bunch of cards that are pairs (of animals, or shapes,
                    or colours). The cards are all mixed up and put face down. Each player takes turns to flip over two cards: if they are a
                    pair, you keep the cards. If not, you turn the cards face down again. When all the cards are taken,
                    the player with most pairs wins. Make the game in Scratch. You can either make the whole game yourself, or

                <p>
                    Your garden has been invaded by moles. Make a game where the player clicks on moles that pop up randomly
                    to earn points. Getting started:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                        <li>Make a mole sprite that appears in random positions.</li>
                        <li>Use the mouse to "whack" the mole by clicking it.</li>
                        <li>Add a score counter that goes up when the mole is clicked.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    More advanced:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                        <li>Add a timer to see how many points the player can earn in 30 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Show more than one mole at a time. The scratch 'clone' block is good for this.</li>
                        <li>Make some moles have different colors, with different point values.</li>
                        <li>Add a "bad" mole that minuses the score if clicked.</li>
                        <li>Make the game harder over time by speeding up how often moles appear.</li>
                    </ul>

                        You could also review and rate the film. It is a 4-star or 5-star film?

                    <li>You could also have web-pages about actors and actresses in these films.</li>

                        pictures you link to.
                        Wikipedia has film images with 'fair use' permissions. For example, the <a

                    and contact me if they're interested. Hopefully I'll get some new customers! I reckon the website

                        a nice quote from the customer about what a good job I did!

                    <li>A "contact us" page, with the address and map of my builder's yard. The yard is actually at the

                <p>
                    How text appears on a webpage depends on which <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font" target="_blank">font</a>
                    is used.
                    For example, we could use the <span
                        style="font-family: courier; font-weight: bold">Courier font</span>, or
                    <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: bold">Verdana font</span>.

                    Write a webpage that shows the same piece of text with different fonts: use the sentence
                    "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog". The text will feel different, depending on the font
                    used.
                    Try finding fonts that look official, funny, old or futuristic. What's your favourite?

                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Websites: Webpage links</h3>
                <p>Links on webpages are usually blue and underlined, and change to purple once clicked. CSS styles
                    let us change this - we can choose how links are displayed. Let's play around this:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                        <li>Setup a blank web page with html, head and body elements.</li>
                        <li>Add a style element inside the head element.</li>
                        <li>Inside the style element, add styles for links in different states.  Normal links are referred to
                            as <b>a:link</b>, links that have just been clicked as <b>a:active</b>, links that have been clicked before as <b>a:visited</b>,
                            and links that the mouse is hovering over as <b>a:hover</b>.</li>
                        <li>For each type of link, you can add styles for foreground colour (like: color: red), background colour (like: background-color: transparent) and text effects (like: text-decoration: bold)</li>
                        <li>Add links to the body of the web page, and see how they're affected by the CSS styles</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                    Your inline style might look like this:

           <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap">
            &lt;style>
            a:link {
                color: green;
                background-color: transparent;
                text-decoration: none;
            }
            a:visited {
                color: pink;
                background-color: transparent;
                text-decoration: none;
            }
            a:hover {
                color: red;
                background-color: transparent;
                text-decoration: underline;
            }
            a:active {
                color: yellow;
                background-color: transparent;
                text-decoration: underline;
            }
            &lt;/style>

                    web forms work.</p>
                <p>Create your own web form for users to enter information about their holiday. You could use text

                    traveled by train, car or aeroplane. You could use a drop down list so users can rate their holiday out of 5
                    (a different entry for 1 star, 2 stars, etc).</p>

                <p>
                    Write a program that plays ‘hangman’. The player guesses letters to complete a secret word.
                    You decide how many turns they get. On each turn:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>The player guesses a letter</li>
                    <li>The computer prints out the word, but shows ‘@‘ for letters not guessed yet. So if the
                        word was ‘dog’ and the player had only guessed ‘d’, the computer would show: ‘d@@’
                    </li>
                    <li>If the player has guessed all letters in the word, it prints the whole word and ‘you
                        won!’
                    </li>
                    <li>If the player hasn’t won, the computer prints ‘number of turns remaining: ___’, and the
                        player
                        has another go.

                <p>
                    Write a program that counts the number of words in a sentence. For example, for “i am an example
                    sentence”, the program would print 5 (words).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then improve your sentence analyser:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Print out the total number of vowels in the sentence. So we’d print 9 for the example.</li>
                    <li>Print out counts for each vowel. For the example sentence, there is 1 ‘i’ and 3 ‘a’s and 5
                        ‘e’s.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make sure your program works for lowercase and uppercase letters. So ‘A’ and ‘a’ should be
                        treated the same. The phrase ‘A cat’ has two vowels, which are both the letter ‘a’.

                <p>Hint: letters are represented inside a computer as numbers. This is called ASCII: so an ‘a’ in
                    ASCII
                    is 97. You’ll need to convert the sentence letters
                    into ASCII, do some addition, then convert them back again. Google to learn about ASCII, and how
                    you
                    convert letters to ASCII (and back again)
                    in your particular programming language.</p>
                <p>More advanced: so you’ve written a program that ‘encrypts’ a sentence into a secret message.
                    Write a
                    ‘decrypt’ program that turns a secret message back into the original sentence.</p>

                <p>
                    Write a program that outputs whether a given number is a factorial (or not).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A factorial of a particular number is that number multiplied by all numbers below it.
                    So 5! (meaning 5 factorial) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calculating 5! is easy. But we want to reverse this. Write a program that tells us
                    that "120" is "5!". The program should work for any number, either reporting that
                    that the number is a factorial, or "NONE" if it isn't. For example:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>120 = 5!</li>

                <p>
                    Make a program that generates random insults :-) The program first asks for your name, then insults
                    you. Here goes..
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>"What's your name?"</li>
                    <li>"Greg"</li>
                    <li>"Hi Greg. You eat like a greasy baboon!". Or maybe "Hi Greg. You run like a purple hippo!"</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>When the program starts, ask the user for their name, then say hello ("Hi Greg").
                    <li>Generating the insult is the tricky bit. Each insult is a sentence with the same structure:
                        "Hi (Greg - name). You (eat - verb) like a (greasy - adjective) (baboon - noun). So we'll
                        generate the insult
                        by randomly picking a verb, adjective and noun, then making a sentence out of them:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                            <li>Make a list of verbs. How about: eat, run and swim.</li>
                            <li>Make a list of adjectives. How about: greasy, smelly, grumpy.</li>
                            <li>Make a list of nouns. How about: baboon, cardboard box, dolphin.</li>
                            <li>Now we'll generate the insult by randomly picking a word from each of the three lists,
                                and combining them
                                into a sentence.
                            </li>
                            <li>Go make some fun insults!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More advanced:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Make the insults more complicated and longer. Use bigger lists of verbs, adjectives and nouns.
                    </li>
                    <li>Why stop with random sentence generation - try random story generation! Use the same approach,
                        but your lists are now of whole sentences rather than single words. So define the story's
                        standard structure,
                        then randomly fill in story gaps with randomly picked sentences:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                            <li>I was born (in Paris, under an autumn sky | with a tail | 3 days early).</li>
                            <li>My mother (ate chips all day | loved to dance | howled at the moon).</li>
                            <li>All I could do was (vacuum the cat | take up break dancing | cook bacon and eggs).</li>
                        </ul>

                    Getting your driving licence requires you to pass a "theory test". Write a program that lets you
                    practice the theory test: the program asks you a set of multiple-choice questions, tells you whether
                    you
                    correctly answered each question, and tells you your final score at the end. Here's an example
                    question:
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will find that driving smoothly can:

                    <li>increase journey times by about 15%</li>
                </ol>
                When presented with this question, the user types in the number of the answer they think is correct
                (e.g. 1 - incorrect). The program then states whether the user is correct or not, and moves onto the
                next question.

                <p>
                    There is a light that switches on when someone enters the room, and switches off when they leave.
                    If multiple people are in the room, the light stays on until the last person leaves.
                    Write a program that outputs how long the light stays on, given a list of when people entered
                    and left the room.

                        of size 2, 2 cruisers of size 3, and one battleship of size 4.

                    <li>On the player's turn, they again specify a board square they wish to "shoot". A ship can be hit
                        as before (represented by "x"),
                        but is only completely sunk when all the ship's squares are hit (represented by "*"). So the
                        player is told
                        if they "HIT", "MISSED", or "SUNK" a ship, and the board is updated.

                <p>
                    What if you need to find particular letter sequences in a large piece of text, like all
                    email addresses, or all phone numbers? You'll need something
                    called a "regular expression" for that. A regular expression lets you define the pattern of letters
                    that you're
                    looking for, and then find all letter sequences matching that pattern. For example, the regular
                    expression "ab+a" says "match sequences of letters that start with 'a', are followed by any number
                    of 'b's,
                    and end with another 'a'. So this regular expression matches "aba", "abba", "abbba" and so on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    5 friends (called Alex, Ben, Caitlin, Dean and Erin) are playing a game, and keeping track of
                    scores. When someone scores a point,

                    uppercase. So "aaAb" means in that
                    round Alex (player "a") gained two points then lost a point, then Ben (player "b") gained a point.
                    Write a program which takes in the
                    recorded scores, and gives the total scores for each player, ranked high to low. So "aaaAb" would

                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Coding: Convert currency with API data</h3>
                <p>
                    Write a program that converts one currency amount to another. Here is an example of UK pounds (GBP)
                    to US dollars (USD):
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Input: 1.22 GBP to USD</li>
                    <li>Output: 1.57 USD</li>
                </ul>
                You will need currency conversion information: for each currency what is the rate to convert into other
                currencies?
                To start with, just allow conversions from UK pounds (GBP) to 3 other currencies, using these conversion
                rates:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>GBP -> USD: 1.2793188994</li>
                    <li>GBP -> EUR: 1.1276499774</li>
                    <li>GBP -> JPY: 143.3581416328</li>
                </ul>
                Now to make it more fun, use an Internet API to get live currency conversion information. Use <a
                    href="https://exchangeratesapi.io" target="_blank">https://exchangeratesapi.io</a>:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>To see all GBP conversion rates: <a  href="https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=GBP"
                                                            target="_blank">https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=GBP</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>To see just the GBP->USD conversion rate: <a
                            href="https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?symbols=USD,GBP" target="_blank">https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?symbols=USD,GBP</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>And check out all the documentation at: <a  href="https://exchangeratesapi.io" target="_blank">https://exchangeratesapi.io</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                You will need to call the API for currency information, load the response (which is in JSON format),
                read out the currency conversion
                rate you want, and use it.

                <p>
                    Assume a word only contains the letters 'x' and 'y'. Write a program that checks if a word contains
                    the same number of 'x's and 'y'. For example:

                    You have to do the same thing over and over when you write a website by hand - what if you could
                    write a
                    program to do all the boring bits for you? We're going to write a program which generates webpages
                    automatically!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>You are going to use text handling and user input commands.</li>
                    <li>Firstly we need to get some information from the user. Ask for the page title, body text and
                        background colour. In Python use the <a  target="_blank"
                                                                href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_user_input.asp">input()

                    </li>
                    <li>We need some variables containing the default HTML code that is on every page. You could have a
                        variable called <b>Header</b> which has everything up to the body tag and another called <b>Footer</b>
                        with everything at the end.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add all the different parts of the web page together: the title and so on supplied by the
                        user, and the default HTML code. Use the concatenation operator <b>+</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Print your HTML text to the screen. Copy the HTML into a text editor, save it to a file with <b>.html</b>
                        on the end and open it in a web browser to see how it looks.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    There are a few online tools that can help you learn about databases.  W3schools have a tool that lets you play with a SQL (Simple Query Language) database - have a go!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting started:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Visit <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all">https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all</a> in your web browser.  There is an example customer database for a shop ready for you to use.</li>
                    <li>Before you begin, click the "Restore Database" button on the right to reset the database.</li>
                    <li>Try running this SQL statement: "SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY CustomerName;".<br/>
                        The SQL statement queries the database, asking for all fields in the Customers table ordered by customer name. Look at the result - is it correct?</li>
                    <li>Change the ORDER BY part of the SQL statement so that the result is ordered by city.  Look at the result - did it work?</li>
                    <li>Change the SQL Statement to extract all the customers with names starting with A.  You will need to use WHERE, LIKE and wildcards to do this.  WHERE restricts the query to a field within a table.  LIKE compares the contents of a field with the thing you want.
                        The thing you want is defined with a string and a Wildcard - don't forget to put the string in quote marks 'like this'.  In this case you can use the wildcard % which means zero or more letters, so 'A%' means any entry beginning with A.
                        To learn more, try the SQL tutorial at <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/sql</a>.</li>
                    <li>Change the SQL Statement to find the price of the most expensive product.  You will need the MAX function to get the maximum value and the AS function to give the database somewhere to put the result.</li>

                <p>
                    Write a program that converts a word into morse code, where each letter is shown as dots and dashes
                    The codes for 'a' to 'z' are:

                <p>
                    More advanced: write a program that takes a word in morse code, and converts it back to the original word.
                    So "...---..." is "sos". This reverser program is trickier than it looks, as multiple words can have the
                    same morse code (when all the dots and dashes are squashed together). In the examples above, "bits" and "three"
                    are both "-.....-...". To make the reverser program easier to code:

                        <li>First change your convertor program to put a space between each letter code. "bits" is now
                            "-... .. - ..." and "three" is now "- .... .-. . .", so the two words look different. Decoding
                            should now be easier, as you can see the individual letter codes - which are now separated by spaces.</li>
                        <li>Then change your convertor program back, so there's not space between letter codes. Decoding
                            is trickier, as you'll need to write out all the words that the morse code could decode to. So
                            "-.....-..." can be "bits" or "three".</li>

                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Coding: Picture ideas generator</h3>
                <p>Sometimes you fancy drawing a picture, but don't know what to draw. What you need is a picture
                    ideas generator!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's how it works. You will write a program that prints out a suggestion of something to draw:
                    "Draw a picture of a monkey wearing a hat, standing in front of a mountain", or "Draw a
                    picture of a rabbit wearing a jumper, standing in front of a dustbin".
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do this:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                        <li>Make a list (array) of animals: monkey, rabbit, etc</li>
                        <li>Make a list (array) of clothes: hat, jumper, etc</li>
                        <li>Make a list (array) of clothes: hat, jumper, etc</li>
                        <li>Randomly pick a word from each of the three lists, then combine them into a sentence</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you get the idea of making a sentence out of randomly chosen words, make the sentence
                    more complicated. So you could replace "standing in front of" with say "dancing on top of", or
                    whatever.
                </p>

                    At Stirling CoderDojo, we have micro:bits to play with. Ask a mentor if you would like to use one. A
                    micro:bit is a cool
                    little computer with LEDs, a compass, motion detection and temperature detection. So you can make it
                    to do cool stuff like show the temperature when you shake it! There’s a web-based Block Editor (like
                    Scratch) for writing and testing code. When you’re happy with the code, you need to transfer the
                    code to the micro:bit. To do this:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Plug the micro:bit into your computer using the usb cable. The micro:bit should show up in your
                        computer as a new hard drive
                    </li>
                    <li>Click ‘compile’ in the Block Editor, and your code will download to your computer in a file
                        called
                        ‘something.hex’
                    </li>
                    <li>Drag and drop the ‘something.hex’ file onto the micro:bit hard drive. The code should now be
                        running on the micro:bit!
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Make a hold-it-there game. The object of this game is to light up all the LEDs on the Microbit and keep them on - but it's
                    not so easy!  When your program detects the Microbit is tilted forward, light up the LEDs one after the other.  Stop lighting
                    the LEDs when the Microbit is held flat.  Every time you light a new LED make the time before you light the next LED shorter.
                    Use a variable with a name like LEDtime to hold the current time interval. Each time a LED is lit, LEDtime decreases.  When all
                    the LEDs are lit wait for LEDtime then turn them all off again. Now its tricky to light all the LEDs without having to
                    start over again. Program one of the buttons on the Microbit to reset the game.</p>

                <p>
                    You’ve made a New Year’s resolution to do more exercise, like walking. Make a step counter with your microbit
                    (that counts how many steps you’ve walked). Getting started:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                        <li>Use the “shake” to detect a step, then show the number on the screen.</li>
                        <li>Test your step counter by somehow attaching it to your foot. You’ll need a battery pack too!</li>
                        <li>Maybe have a reset button, so you can set the counter back to zero.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Microbits: Consonant or Vowel?</h3>
                <p>In this game the player has one second to press button A when a consonant is displayed on the microbit screen, and button B when a vowel is displayed.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>Start this challenge by displaying the letters A or B.  You will need to use the Random function to choose which.
                    <li>You will need two variables to remember if either button has been pressed.  Use the "on button pressed" event to set a variable to 1.
                    <li>Set a delay of 1 second after A or B is shown and then check your variables to see if the button was pressed.
                    <li>Display a tick or a cross to show if the correct button was pressed in time.
                    <li>Reset your variables to 0.
                </ul>
                <p>The next part deals with the consonants and vowels.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                    <li>You will need to create two lists, one for all the consonants and one for all the vowels.
                    <li>Where you displayed A or B in your code above, you should display either a random vowel from the vowel list, or a random consonant from the consonant list.
                </ul>

                    <li>Button A starts the stopwatch.</li>
                    <li>Button A (2nd press) stops the stopwatch.</li>
                    <li>Button A (3rd press) restarts the stopwatch, and so on.</li>
                    <li>Button B stops the stopwatch, and resets the seconds counter to zero.</li>

                <h3 class="text-3xl mb-2">Microbits: Daytime Detector</h3>

                <p>Make your microbit into a "daytime detector", and show a sun when it's light, and nothing when it's dark.</p>

                <p>Hints:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
                        <li>Use the "light level" variable (in the "Input" section of the editor) to detect light level</li>
                        <li>You'll need to show the sun when the "light level" is bigger than say 100</li>
                        <li>You'll need a "forever" block to keep checking the light level</li>
                        <li>You should be able to test your "daytime detector" by shining a light at it (and the sun should appear) or covering it with your hand (the sun should disappear).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>More advanced: change the size of the sun shown, depending on the light level. So show a small sun when it's a bit bright, and a big sun when it's really bright.</p>
